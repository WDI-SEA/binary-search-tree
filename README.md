# Binary Search Tree

Implement a binary search tree data structure, which is a special case of a binary tree that follows specific rules. 

The rule that a binary search tree follows in this case is:

* It is a binary tree (no more than 2 children)
* A node's left child has a value that is is less than the node's own value
* A node's right child has a value that is is greater than or equal to the node's own value

## Directions

Find the starter code in `binarySearchTree.js` or `binary_search_tree.py`. Pick the language of your choice. Implement all functions!

## Bonuses

* Implement this in the other language
* Implement an in-order, post-order, or pre-order traversal
